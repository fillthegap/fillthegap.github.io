      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if anyone is reading this but here goes nothing, 2020 was such an odd year (I guess for everyone). first of all, got my diploma in an odd state, after being informed at march that due to the severeness of this virus giving exams is almost impossible I was worried about the state of my education, also hearing that IB students gave no exams and got horrible results from IB representatives with their academic performance (somewhat randomized since everyone put effort on studying for finals rather than research topics) , it was tougher for us since the Iranian education ministry is more strict and offers no value for off-site exams and the Dubai Knowledge and Development Authority does not allow on-site exams (because they were responsible for students, totaly understandable).</description>

      <description>The Journey It goes back all the way in November when Fedora Project tweeted that they need some Mentors for Google Code-in. Initially I didn&amp;rsquo;t knew what it was but after a simple search it was clear that it was a competition ran by Google.
So Google provided all the backend and platform for open source organizations, which mentors of each org then creates tasks in the system, which then the student solves.</description>

      <description>In December 1st we were told by our CS teacher that there will be a Robocup held in Dubai, I was really intrested and since the material they introduced was mostly graphical with some Arduino code in it, I decided to join although I had limited experience in both of these subjects. The school created a workshop + election process at friday, which consisted of using the code to run virtual robots in an area, which was powered by Microsoft Robotics suit and Nvidia PhysX.</description>
